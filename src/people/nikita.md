I am pursing my PhD studies, under the supervision of Dr. Richard Lange, as one of the first students in RIT's cognitive science program. I obtained my major in computer science, with a minor in mathematics, from the University of Wyoming. I am interested in the intersection between neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. In particular, the strange overlap and contrast between bio-inspired artificial intelligence and the brain can expose details about neural systems. Using that knowledge, we can use to extend and refine our understanding of the brain, learn how to best engineer neural systems, and reveal small components of the true nature of intelligence. Currently, I am working with representational similarity to identify, compare, and study the internal representations neural systems use to process information.
