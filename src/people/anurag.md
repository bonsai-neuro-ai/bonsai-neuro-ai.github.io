I am a PhD student @ RIT working under the supervision of the brains behind the BONSAI Lab: Dr. Richard Lange. Before coming to Rochester, I completed my BSc in Computer Science and Information Technology in Kathmandu, Nepal (2024). 

My current research interest lies more on the AI side of *NeuroAI* -- trying to teach Machine Learning models to come up with "good" "representations" of data. You may refer to the Research section of the website to learn more. Throughout my PhD, I aspire to take full advantage of the two-way bridge between "Neuro" and "AI" to explore *what makes a good representation* and contribute to the answer in ways that are both useful and insightful.
