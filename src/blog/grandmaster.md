### "The Grandmaster"
 
The Grandmaster plays a most beautiful game.<br />
With flourish and flair, pieces twirl, stomp, and sing.

A ballet of movement advances the knight.<br />
A tactical blunder, but oh! What a sight!

Opponent impassive, it calculates mate.<br />
Rote execution, inexorable fate.

The Grandmaster plays in humanity's name,<br />
Not to win, but to play a most beautiful game.
