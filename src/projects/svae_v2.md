Former MS student Shounak Desai wrote his thesis doing some initial exploration of Stochastic Variational AutoEncoders, a fundamental extension of VAEs to use stochastic recognition models, leveraging the hybrid MCMC+VI approaches mentioned in blurbs above. This is promising initial work but we need another student to pick up where Shounak left off.
